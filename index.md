Hi! I am a Ph.D student of Civil Engineering (concentration on Operations Research) at Johns Hopkins University [(Center for Systems Science and Engineering)](https://engineering.jhu.edu/civil/research/systems/). Before I join JHU, I recieved master degree of Industrial Engineering from University of Wisconsin at Madison, where I worked with [Prof. Vicki Bier](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/faculty/bier_vicki) and her PhD student Mark Zhou. I also recieved bachelor's degree in Material Science and Chemical Engineering from [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/) respectively. 

## Research Interest

I am interested in applying mathmatical programming, stochastic modeling and simulation to the field of healthcare systems, energy problems and etc.

## Projects

* **Advanced Health Accessed Project**         09/2018-12/2018

Applying simulation and stochastic programming model to rebuild the appiontment schedule for [SSM Health Hospital](https://www.ssmhealth.com/). The waiting time for Acute visits can be reduced from around six weeks to within one week.

* **Game-Theoretic Modelling of Pre-diaster Relocation**     10/2017-12/2018

We built a game-theoretic model for government and residents at high flood risk area. Under different situations, the optimal strategy for government can be found. To minimize the total cost, governmnet could offer a subsidy for the residents and encourage them to leave before the flood happens. I had a presentation about this project at [INFORMS](https://www.informs.org/) Annual Meeting 2018.
More realistic analysis can be applied with the data form New 
York city. Professor Bier and Mark are keep working on this topic.

* **CO2 Heat Pump Systems**  09/2015-05/2016

I took part in the research and development of CO2 Heat Pump and Built up the control system. This product uses CO2 as freezing agent, which is harmless for environment. Now, [Kunming Dongqi Technology](http://www.r744.com/companies/view/china_kunming_dongqi_technology_) has produced high performance CO2 Heat Pump and sold over China and Singpore.
