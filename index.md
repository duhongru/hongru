Hi! I am a student of Civil Engineering (Concentration on Operations Research) at Johns Hopkins University [(Center for Systems Science and Engineering)](https://engineering.jhu.edu/civil/research/systems/). Before I join JHU, I recieved master degree of Industrial Engineering from University of Wisconsin at Madison, where I worked with [Prof. Vicki Bier](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/faculty/bier_vicki) and her PhD student Mark Zhou. I also recieved bachelor's degree in Material Science and Chemical Engineering from [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/) respectively.
